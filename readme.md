# **Example Chrome Extension (CoffeeScript)**

This is a blank template Chrome extension with a basic event/message passing skeleton for you to easily get started building a Chrome extension.

To compile the files locally, install CoffeeScript via `npm install coffeescript`, then run `coffee -cw .` to compile `.coffee` files every time you save. I have gitignored .js files to keep the directories clean.

I've also included Mixpanel for tracking, just drop an API key associated with your project into the `mixpanel.js` file.

### MVC
- Popup script (view)
- Content script (controller)
- Background script (model)

### Purpose

I wanted to create this for myself, as a start place for future extensions, but figured it might help you out as well. I hope it does.

### Contributing

Feel free to clone this repo and submit a pull request to add other basic elements of a useful Chrome extension.
